## Growth mindset
a growth mindset belives that ones fundementals abilities can be improved with perseverence and effort. raw intelligence and talent are only a starting point.
when you start to doubt yourself double down on the problem, go into a new topic expecting to face new challenges and setbacks, when i start to get frustrated take some time to decompress.
